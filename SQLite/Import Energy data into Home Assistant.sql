Import energy/water data into Home Assistant

HOW-TO:

Tooling
- Download and install: DB Browser (64 bit) for SQLite https://sqlitebrowser.org/ (tested windows version 3.12.2)
- Download and install/configure: WinSCP (https://winscp.net/eng/download.php)

Source data preparation
- Check whether a script/how-to exists for your provider (datasources directory)
	Script/how-to exists:
		Follow how-to to prepare the needed CSV files
	Script/How-to does not exist:
		Determine how to get the data from your energy provider (download/API etc.)
		Get the data from the energy provider using the identified method
		Convert the data in the needed CSV files. The generic data conversion script TemplateDataPrepare.py can be used in most cases.
		In case the CSV files are created manually the CSV files should follow the following simple definition where each row contains: Epoch Unix Timestamp, sensor value
			Example:
				1540634400,8120605
				1540638000,8120808
				1540641600,8120993
				1540645200,8121012
		Depending on the used sensors determine which CSV data files need to be created:
			elec_feed_in_tariff_1_high_resolution.csv
				Contains the highest resolution usage data available (for instance: hour resolution)
				Used in case there is only one tariff
			elec_feed_in_tariff_1_low_resolution.csv
				Contains the lowest resolution usage data available (for instance: day resolution)
				Used in case there is only one tariff
				Not needed in case that there is only one resolution available.
			elec_feed_in_tariff_2_high_resolution.csv
				Contains the highest resolution usage data available (for instance: hour resolution)
				Not needed in case that there is only one tariff available.
			elec_feed_in_tariff_2_low_resolution.csv
				Contains the lowest resolution usage data available (for instance: day resolution)
				Not needed in case that there is only one tariff available.
				Not needed in case that there is only one resolution available.
			elec_feed_out_tariff_1_high_resolution.csv
				Contains the highest resolution production data available (for instance: hour resolution)
				Used in case there is only one tariff
				Not needed in case that there is no production (for instance: no solar panels, no battery export)
			elec_feed_out_tariff_1_low_resolution.csv
				Contains the lowest resolution production data available (for instance: day resolution).
				Used in case there is only one tariff
				Not needed in case that there is no production (for instance: no solar panels, no battery export)
				Not needed in case that there is only one resolution available.
			elec_feed_out_tariff_2_high_resolution.csv
				Contains the highest resolution production data available (for instance: hour resolution).
				Not needed in case that there is no production (for instance: no solar panels, no battery export)
				Not needed in case that there is only one tariff available.
			elec_feed_out_tariff_2_low_resolution.csv
				Contains the lowest resolution production data available (for instance: day resolution).
				Not needed in case that there is no production (for instance: no solar panels, no battery export)
				Not needed in case that there is only one tariff available.
				Not needed in case that there is only one resolution available.
			elec_solar_high_resolution.csv
				Contains the highest resolution production data available (for instance: hour resolution)
				Not needed in case that there are no solar panels
			elec_solar_low_resolution.csv
				Contains the lowest resolution production data available (for instance: day resolution)
				Not needed in case that there are no solar panels
				Not needed in case that there is only one resolution available.
			gas_high_resolution.csv
				Contains the highest resolution production data available (for instance: hour resolution).
				Not needed in case that there is no gas usage
			gas_low_resolution.csv
				Contains the lowest resolution production data available (for instance: day resolution).
				Not needed in case that there is no gas usage
				Not needed in case that there is only one resolution available.
			water_high_resolution.csv
				Contains the highest resolution production data available (for instance: hour resolution).
				Not needed in case that there is no water usage
			water_low_resolution.csv
				Contains the lowest resolution production data available (for instance: day resolution).
				Not needed in case that there is no water usage
				Not needed in case that there is only one resolution available.

Home Assistant preparation
- Create a backup of the Home Assistant database
	Disable recorder while making the backup -> Developer tools/Services/Call service: Recorder:disable
- Download the created backup
- Stop the Home Assistant core
	Developer tools/Services/Call service: Home Assistant Core Integration: Stop
- Home Assistant data: 
	extract: "home-assistant_v2.db" (from "backup.tar" extract "homeassistant.tar.gz" from "data" folder)
	As an alternative it is also possible to download the "home-assistant_v2.db" directly from the Home Assistant "config" directory (For example: use WinSCP in combination with the Home Assistant SSH addon).
	In case of this method make sure that you didn't skip the step to create a backup so that you can always restore this version of the database!

Import the data
- Start "DB Browser for SQLite"
- Open project "Import Energy data into Home Assistant.sqbpro". If the database is not loaded directly you have to open the "home-assistant_v2.db" database manually ("Open Database").
- Validate the schema version of the database (Browse Data -> Table: schema_version)
  The script has been tested with schema version 42. With higher versions you should validate if the structure of the "statistics" and "short_term_statistics" tables have changed.
  used fields in table "statistics": metadata_id, state, sum, start_ts, created_ts
  used fields in table "short_term_statistics": sum
- Import, one at a time, all the created CSV data elec*, gas* and water* files (File -> Import -> Table from CSV file...)
  It is possible to load data from multiple CSV's with the same name. The data of the second import is than added to the existing tables.
  This can be used in case there are multiple energy source providers for different timeperiods. In this case you first import the files from the first energy provider and than then second etc.
- Lookup in the "statistics_meta" table the ID's of the sensors (Browse Data -> Table: statistics_meta; You can use "filter" to find the id of the sensor)
  The names of the sensors can be looked up in the Home Assistant Energy dashboard (Settings -> Dashboards -> Energy).
  Example:
 	id  statistic_id                                	source      unit_of_measurement
	6	sensor.gas_meter								recorder	m³
	7	sensor.electricity_meter_feed_in_tariff_1		recorder	kWh
	8	sensor.electricity_meter_feed_in_tariff_2		recorder	kWh
	9	sensor.electricity_meter_feed_out_tariff_1		recorder	kWh
	10	sensor.electricity_meter_feed_out_tariff_2		recorder	kWh
	352	sensor.solar_energy_produced_today				recorder	kWh
	653	sensor.watermeter_quantity_m3					recorder	m³
- Change the script below and remove/comment out the lines of the sensors that are not needed.
  They can be found at the top of the script by looking up the lines where "* Change *" has been added in the SQL statement.
- Change the script below and update the ID's according to the found ID's in the "statistics_meta" table.
  They can be found at the top of the script by looking up the lines where "* Change *" has been added in the SQL statement.
  Determine also the correction factor in case the unit_of_measurement of the sensor differs from the provided data. The unit of measurement of the datasource can be found in the readme of the datasource.
- Execute the SQL and wait for it to complete. (Please be patient because this can take some time!)
- Commit the changes by selecting "Write changes" in the toolbar, if the script ends without errors. In case of an error select "Revert changes" and correct the error and execute the script again.

Replace Home Assistant database
- Make sure that the Home Assistant core is still stopped (Home Assistant UI does not respond)
- Upload "home-assistant_v2.db" to the Home Assistant "config" directory (For example: use WinSCP in combination with the Home Assistant SSH addon). 
- Restart/reboot Home Assistant (physically reboot Home Assistant or login using PUTTY-SSH and execute the "reboot" command)
- Validate the imported data in the "Energy Dashboard"
- Enjoy :-)


Background information:

Normal tariff meter values without correction for solar usage
elec_feed_in_tariff_1_high_resolution.csv (for instance: hourly)
elec_feed_in_tariff_1_low_resolution.csv (for instance: daily)

Low tariff meter values without correction for solar usage
elec_feed_in_tariff_2_high_resolution.csv (for instance: hourly)
elec_feed_in_tariff_2_low_resolution.csv (for instance: daily)

Normal tariff production meter values 
elec_feed_out_tariff_1_high_resolution.csv (for instance: hourly)
elec_feed_out_tariff_1_low_resolution.csv (for instance: daily)

Low tariff production meter values
elec_feed_out_tariff_2_high_resolution.csv (for instance: hourly)
elec_feed_out_tariff_2_low_resolution.csv (for instance: daily)

Solar production meter values
elec_solar_high_resolution.csv (for instance: hourly)
elec_solar_low_resolution.csv (for instance: daily)

Gas meter values
gas_high_resolution.csv (for instance: hourly)
gas_low_resolution.csv (for instance: daily)

Water meter values
water_high_resolution.csv (for instance: hourly)
water_low_resolution.csv (for instance: daily)


Daily reset of values is also handled by the script. This is the same case as a new meter.
Long term statistics (1 hour interval) => statistics
Short term statistics (5 min interval) => statistics_short_term

Short term statistics are rolled over to long term statistics.
Both tables need to be updated according to the new imported data which changes the sum column!
